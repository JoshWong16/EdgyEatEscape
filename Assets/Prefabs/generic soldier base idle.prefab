  Dialogue: The Wump World was a small world, very much smaller than our world. There
    were no great oceans, lofty mountains, giant forests, or broad sandy deserts.   The
    Wump World was mostly grassy meadows and clumps of leafy green trees with a few
    winding rivers and lakes. But it was perfect for the   Wumps, who were the only
    creatures living there. The Wumps were simple grass-eaters and spent most of their
    time grazing on the tall tender grass   that grew in the meadows. In warm weather
    they cooled themselves in the crystal-clear rivers and lakes. And at night they
    slept in the shelter of the   bumbershoot trees to keep the dew off their backs.
    Since the Wumps had no enemies they wandered around just as they pleased with
    nothing whatever to   worry about. ever, the Wumps would have worried if they
    had known that someone a million miles away was watching their little world. One   morning
    the Wumps were awakened by a far-off humming sound. It seemed to be coming from
    somewhere above, and as the humming grew into a heavy roar,   the sleepy-eyed
    Wumps crept through the trees for a peek at the sky. Zooming straight for the
    earth came a great flock of potbellied monsters,   with tails and fins, spitting
    fire and shooting out streaks of black smoke. As the monsters swooped down to
    land, huge legs sprang from their bulging  sides, and like gaping mouths doors
    flew open, then ramps shot to the ground. And down the ramps came a horde of tiny
    creatures swarming out   onto the meadow. These were the Pollutians from the planet
    Pollutus. = gay?
